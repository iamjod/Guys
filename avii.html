            The youngest girl, no longer exist on Discord <br> but I believe y'all had fun playing Gartic with
            her as long as she existed. <br>
            I don't know if she'll get to see this but at least she's a counted member of our group.<br> Yayyayay. I
            don't
            know what else can I say about her,<br> she doesn't really do anything

                    You really make a difference in other's life, although this type
                    of stuff isn't my thing to say but yeah you deserve this compliment.
                    You really work hard in your studies and I believe you'll make good of a doctor, just remember to
                    never stop hard working, as your father never did, he needs to get in return what he provived.
                    Because he too, need a difference
